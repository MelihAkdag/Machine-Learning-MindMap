# Machine-Learning-MindMap
This is a mindmap for step by step machine learning projects using Python.

This is a project which I have started while I was learning Machine Learning.

It looks scary and complicated. But it could be very useful.

You can download the mindmap as a PNG file or X-Mind file.

I would suggest you to use X-Mind file. Because that way you can fold or unfold branches according to your selection of algorithms.
