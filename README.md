# Machine-Learning-MindMap
This is a mindmap for step by step machine learning projects using Python.

This is a project which I have started while I was learning Machine Learning.

It looks scary and complicated. But it could be very useful.

You can download the mindmap as a PNG file or X-Mind file.

I would suggest you to use X-Mind file. Because that way you can fold or unfold branches according to your selection of algorithms.

Link for X-Mind software: https://www.xmind.net/xmind2020/

Check periodically for updates, because I am planning to improve the mind map while I am using the file and learning new things.

Feel free to pull requests and improve the file, and please don't forget to share your version with us.
